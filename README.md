## General info
A full-stack CRUD React app that allows users to maintain a log of all cryptocurrency buy/sell transactions on exchanges that they transact on. We believe that there is a use case here to assist cryptocurrency traders in keeping track of their transactions across multiple exchanges. Back end of project can be accessed [here](https://github.com/benjipt/cryptolog_api).

## Technologies
(Front End)
- React
- CSS / Bootstrap
- Javascript / JSX

## Project status
Complete w/ plans to add future updates/features:
- User can see running profit & loss from their transactions by coin.
- Implement sessions for authentication using JWT.
- Transactions are mapped to specific users.
- User can see their tax owed from profit/loss on each coin & factors for short-term vs. long-term capital gains.
- User can reset password.
- User can validate email.
- Fix known issue: Login Form & New User Form can surface at same time.
- Fix known issue: Transaction does not update automatically on page after edit form submission.
- Fix known issue: password match conditional notification should only render when passwords do not match (briefly renders even when matching).
